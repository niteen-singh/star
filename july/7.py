#initiation of learning python 

print("Hello, World!")

#we can print anything using print keyword since i am printing an sting so it is quotes

print("Cheers, Mate!")

#Python has no command for declaring a variable.
#A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

x = 5
y = "rakesh"
print(x)
print(y)

#Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

# x is of type int
x = 4       
# x is now of type str
x = "suresh" 
print(x)

#If we want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
